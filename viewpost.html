                                Some of the content consists of earlier versions of already published works, while other portions are new material. 
                                These books are extremely detailed, often analysing a scrap of paper to provide the full evolution of two or even 
                                three different versions of a passage that were rewritten over each other. Despite the great amount of material in 
                                the twelve volumes, numerous unpublished texts are still known to exist[2] in the Bodleian and Marquette University 
                                libraries and in other papers held by individuals or organizations, such as the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship.
                                The first five books track the early history of The Silmarillion and related texts. Books six to nine discuss the 
                                development of The Lord of the Rings; book nine also discusses the NÃºmenor story in the form of The Notion Club Papers. 
                                Books ten and eleven focus on material from the Silmarillion that Tolkien worked on after The Lord of the Rings was published, 
                                including the Annals of Beleriand and the Annals of Aman. Book twelve discusses the development of the Appendices
                                to The Lord of the Rings and examines assorted writings from the last years of Tolkien's life.
